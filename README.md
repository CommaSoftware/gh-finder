# GH Finder
*This program is being developed as part of the IT-start 2023 ESSUTM hackathon.*

GH FINDER is a web interface for searching similar repositories on GitHub. Just put a link to the repository to find similar projects in other GitHub repositories.

As a prototype, we have prepared a search engine that searches exclusively for Java loggers. It sounds ridiculous. But it allowed us to concentrate on one semantic core and test our hypothesis on this example

## How does it work?
We use pre-formed semantic kernels in the form of a list of keywords on a topic.

For analysis, we use the following information about repositories:
1. Name
2. Description
3. README.md file
4. Keywords
5. Technologies used
